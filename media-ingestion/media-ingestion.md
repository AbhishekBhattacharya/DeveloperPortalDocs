# Media Ingest and Acquisition
In order to increase media workflows efficiency and reduce costs, achieve quick processing, and reach a wide global audience,  media content must be uploaded to the Kaltura VPaaS cloud for prepartion, management and archival. Media ingestion is the process through which your media assets (video, audio, image, documents files) are moved from the source (local file system, remote servers, cameras, commercial media repositories and licensors, etc.) to be stored and managed in the Kaltura VPaaS. 

Once the content has been ingested into Kaltura, you will be able to manage, manipulate, distribute, monetize and share the asset using the Kaltura APIs. 
Kaltura VPaaS is designed to handle unparalleled volumes of media assets and scale automatically as needed for your workflow needs. No more worrying about scaling your storage instances, handling upload queues or managing instances - the Kaltura API abstracts and relibly takes care of the media ingest process for you, and provides multiple methodologies and tools to suit your workflow needs and technology stack.
