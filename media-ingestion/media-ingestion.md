# What is Media Ingest and Acquisition?
Ingestion and acquisition is the process through which your media assets (video, audio, image, documents files) are moved from the source (local file system, remote servers, cameras, commercial media repositories and licensors, etc.) to be stored and managed by the Kaltura VPaaS cloud. Once the content has been ingested into Kaltura, you will be able to manage, manipulate, distribute, monetize and share the asset using the Kaltura APIs.

## Media Ingestion APIs
The Kaltura VPaaS offers many ways for ingesting content; a file upload API, bulk files import using CSV or XML, MRSS ingest services, and various widgets you can integrate into your workflows or sites to allow user contributions and build custom upload interfaces.
