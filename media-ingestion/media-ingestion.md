# What is Media Ingest and Acquisition?
Ingestion and acquisition is the process through which your media assets (video, audio, image, documents files) are moved from the source (local file system, remote servers, cameras, commercial media repositories and licensors, etc.) to the Kaltura VPaaS cloud. Once the content has been ingested into Kaltura, you will be able to manage, manipulate, distribute, monetize and share the asset using the Kaltura APIs.
