## Introduction to Playlist Management

Playlists are a useful tool in a variety of different scenarios:
* String a number of entries together to playback one after the other.
* Use playlists to power sections of the application UI, making content lists easy to order or even created automatically.

Kaltura supports two different types of playlists:
* Manual Playlists: Content is manually added and sorted
* Rule-Based / Conditional Playlists: Content is added based on a set of filters, and is sorted based on selected criteria.

To learn more about how playlists are configured and used see:

### QuickStart
Kaltura playlists can be added, updated, deleted and listed via the [`playlist service`](https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/testmeDoc/index.php?service=playlist).
