**Question**: Can the SMS option in the Player Studio Share and Embed field be applied?

**Answer**: SMS sharing is only enabled in the SDK when it detects that you are in a native app; this detection triggers the mobile phone messaging handler when sending a text and the default message text is: "Check out {mediaProxy.entry.name}: {share.shareURL}".
