## About the Kaltura Player  

The Kaltura Universal Player is an industry leader in flexibility, ease of customization, plug-in offerings and loading speed. The Player is designed on the principle of “configure once – deliver everywhere”, which means that every feature incorporated in the Player is supported both tablets and mobile devices, using both HTML5 and Flash with the same configuration, bringing unparalleled ease of feature integration across platforms. 

### Multi-Platform Support  

Our HTML5 video library provides you with the most advanced mobile delivery technology stack available today. Our smart-player technology delivers the right player, stream, and advertising to the right device anywhere, with just a single embed code. In addition, you can extend the functionality of both Flash and HTML5 players with our Unified development API.

### Unparalleled Robust Performance  

The Player library features an advanced resource loader developed in collaboration with Wikimedia Foundation. The resource loader supports dynamically packing of modules, features and player metadata. It minimizes, gizpis and packages, CSS, images, HTML, JavaScript, metadata, and per player features into a single non-blocking payload. This, combined with Kaltura's AutoEmbed embed code, enables the Player rendering to take full advantage of fetch ahead parallel JavaScript resource loading in modern browsers. This delivers fast player rendering even on sites with many other active script includes. 

This means you get best in class performance of all your features, without the delays in traditional feature rich player build out.

Kaltura's flexible player platform integrates with all major ad networks and analytics providers. Kaltura supports a wide range of video ad formats and integrated plugins for numerous video ad networks. This enables you to target viewers with ads on VOD or live videos, across multiple devices including mobile, PC’s, and set-top-boxes. Every Kaltura account includes analytics fully integrated into the Kaltura platform. Additionally Kaltura supports integrations with numerous third-party analytics providers such as Google Analytics, Nielsen Video Census, Nielsen Combined, Comscore and Omniture SiteCatalyst.
