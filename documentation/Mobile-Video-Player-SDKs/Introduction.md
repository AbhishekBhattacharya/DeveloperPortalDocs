## Kaltura’s Mobile Video SDKs for iOS and Android

Kaltura’s Mobile Video SDK for iOS and Android provide the framework and tools to help you easily embed the Kaltura Video Player into native environments in your iOS or Android applications.

The Kaltura Video Player is fully native and offers excellent performance, ensuring that your users receive the best viewing experience. 

The player’s architecture is designed to allow a seamless integration experience, enabling you to connect multiple playback engines and platforms. 

The Kaltura Video Player wraps the playback engine with the same interface and events, thereby allowing the same plugin code to work across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and web.

Each platform supports different types of streaming capabilites and DRMs. The Kaltura Video Player’s technology determines the best streaming delivery method and DRM as needed. The Player API supports sending notifications to the Kaltura Video Player, listening to events, and evaluating properties.
