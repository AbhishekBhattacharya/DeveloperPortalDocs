## Introduction to Media Analytics

Kaltura's Analytics Engine underpins all content-related interactions, covering everything from plays to user-interactions on Player pages, such as likes and shares. All analytics reports are exposed via the API.

To get an idea of what data is available to you, take a look at the following article:

### QuickStart
Kaltura data is exposed via the [`report service`](https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/testmeDoc/index.php?service=report). A number of actions within this service will enable you to pull data against a specific set of filters.

Need a detailed description of what each action does on the report service - its very unclear.

Need to inset live reports and live stats service info here also.
