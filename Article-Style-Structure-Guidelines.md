#Article Style and Structure Guidelines

The following types of content can be used to piece together your document using Markdown syntax:


###Here is a crash course:

```
Paragraphs
Just type regular text without any syntax.


Headings
## for an H2, ### for an H3
Example: ## This is a heading


Text Links
[this is a link](www.google.com) will look like this: this is a link


Notices / Blockquotes
> This indicates that this text will be formatted as a blockquote


Unordered Lists
* This is a list item
* This is another list item


Ordered lists
1. This is a list item
2. This is another list item


Images
To add an image, use the following syntax:
![Image Description](URL)

Code snippets
Code snippets use a backticks syntax.

`this is an inline snippet`

Code blocks use a backticks syntax with an optional language identifier
```ruby
This is a multi-line code block of ruby code
This is a multi-line code block ruby code
This is a multi-line code block ruby code
/``` (without the slash)


Videos
Videos from Kaltura or YouTube can be added by using the following simple syntax:

Kaltura:
{% onebox http://www.kaltura.com/tiny/nex76 %} 

YouTube:
{% onebox https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owh8nBt4QSs %}

```

###Tips for Creating Great Content

* Start with an introduction by answering the question “what will be learned in this document”.

* Think about the steps that will get your reader from A to Z in the fastest way possible while following Kaltura best-practises.

* All sections should be separated by H2 headings (##), subsections by H3 headings (###) and so on.


Remember that your audience is developer-focused, therefore:
* Include code snippets where relevant
* Reference API end-points where applicable
* Reference github/bitbucket repos where applicable
* Clearly explain the required workflows to achieve an end-result


####Don’t forget to spell check.


###Where to put your content?
